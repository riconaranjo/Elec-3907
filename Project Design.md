# **Project Overview**

We are designing a system that is able to track visitors to the <a href="https://carleton.ca/our-stories/story/gather-ring/">Gather-Ring</a>, and then use their location to create a unique pattern that updates as they move around. We hope this adds a whole new level of interactivity for the community with this existing installation. We will be using an array of ultrasonic sensors installed underneath the benches pointing inwards to track the visitors.
