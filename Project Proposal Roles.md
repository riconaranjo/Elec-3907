# **Project Proposal**

Please submit a group project proposal by the end of **29th Jan. 2018**. This proposal should contain:

- Project title.
- An overview of the project and product, with design goals.
- Some system level diagram showing the project elements.
- Preliminary specifications and requirements of the product (can include cost too).
- Possible routes and approaches to the design solution.
- Potential risks and safety assessment.
- A breakdown of the roles and responsibilities of the group.
- A breakdown of project tasks and an estimation of the timing of the project (Gantt chart or similar).
- A list of possible items required.

You can include any other items that you feel may be useful to have to explain the project.
It is expected that the length will be about 4 to 6 sides. Any questions contact Profs. Chaoui or Steele.

## **Criteria**

____________________

### Design goals

    Reformulates the problem based on a methodical review of the problem generalizing and simplifying the problem to be more widely applicable.

### Design specification

    Clearly constructs a set of design specifications and requirements, considering the needs of the client/user. All requirements and specifications are unambiguously and accurately stated.

### Preliminary solutions

    An extensive set of solution concepts and ideas is developed based on a creative process and a systematic review of related design solutions.

### Group time management

    Carefully detailed and realistic breakdown of tasks, excellently presented.

### Written communication

    Clear, organized and supported by evidence or plausible reasoning; language is appropriate and error- free; sources are credible, relevant and properly referenced; graphics are easy to read and understand.

## **Sections + Roles**

____________________

## Introduction

Explain what the project is, and how it would benefit the community. What is the goal? What will it do?

## Specification

What the design requirements are. What needs to be taken into consideration [weatherproof, power, etc.]. Will it have user interactability?

We want an LED pattern installed on the chains on the top of the structure. They will display patterns based of certain criteria such as the day of the year [e.g. Canada Day would include Red + White pattern], perhaps temperature, and perhaps some user interactability?

Think about degradation of equipment [LEDs, wires, etc.], how do we make it waterproof?

**User Interactibility:**

- light up patterns when people sit on the benches?
- light up patterns when people walk across [ripple effect]?

## Design

What is the system design. Which components are needed? How will LEDs be controlled [prototype and final design]? How will the software be designed? How much will parts for the prototype cost?

Ambient light sensor(s) to turn lights on and off?

Who is doing what? [Project roles + responsibilities]

Prototype design and building:

- How will we light up LEDs? [Grid?]
- Two ppl
    - Peter
    - Ibrahim

Software component:

- 4 ppl
    - Rico
    - Jake 
    - Huzaifah
    - Adam

## Timeline

Schedule of what will be completed and when.

Everything needs to be completed by April 11th.

Jan 25th: Preliminary parts for prototype parts need to be ordered

- some addressable LEDs / christmas lights?
- controller [JeeNode?]
- wire?
- fixture? [wood?]

Feb 1st: Order more parts for prototype

- Basic working model [LEDs and development board]
- Work out software architecture

Feb 8th: Order any missing parts for prototype

March 9th: Individual Reports due


## Conclusion

Closing statements.
