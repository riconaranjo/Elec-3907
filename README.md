## Third year engineering project

This is a term long project were we work in groups of 4-6 to design and build a finished product. This allows us to use the technical knowledge from school work, coop experience, and our interests to design something from start to finish.

## Light and Art

My team and I decided to work with Professor Manuel Baez to create something that intersects technology and art. We will be working with him to expand on the <a href="https://carleton.ca/our-stories/story/gather-ring/">Gathering Ring</a> that was designed by three architecture students last year with his help.
