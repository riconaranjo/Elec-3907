# ELEC 3907
## Third year engineering project

This is a term long project where we work in groups of 4-6 to design and build a finished product. This allows us to use the technical knowledge from school work, coop experience, and our interests to design something from start to finish.

## Light and Art

My team and I decided to work with Professor Manuel Baez to create something that intersects technology and art. We will be working with him to expand on the <a href="https://carleton.ca/our-stories/story/gather-ring/">Gathering Ring</a> that was designed by three architecture students last year with his help.

We are designing a system that is able to track visitors to the Gather-Ring, and then use their location to create a unique pattern that updates as they move around. We hope this adds a whole new level of interactivity for the community with this existing installation. We will be using an array of ultrasonic sensors installed underneath the benches pointing inwards to track the visitors.
