# Meeting with Professor Manuel Baez
We met with the professor to talk about how we can work with him. He suggested we work to expand the <a href="https://carleton.ca/our-stories/story/gather-ring/">Gathering Ring</a> the he worked with students last year. We also talked about other ways of expanding it incvolving more hardware components

## LED Strip and Patterns Expansion
This project would involve mostly programming more patterns and more intricate patterns into the LED strips that are over top the beams in the Gathering Ring. They are currently a small length of the beam but the professor would like to expand these to be the full length so that they could illuminate a brighter and more complex lightshow. These patterns would be based of important dates and would show a pattern representing that day(i.e. red and white for Canada Day).

## LED Grid
This project could be much more complicated since it would require doing something new, as opposed to expanding on the existing patterns. This would include installing LEDs to go with the glass shapes hanging on the top chains, and these would be lit up to show patterns much like the LED strip. This could – with significant programming – be used to display images such as a maple leaf as well as patterns.
